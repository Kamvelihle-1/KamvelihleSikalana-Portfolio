    <h2 class="display-2">About me</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I am a 20 years old young man from Cape Town, South Africa, with a great passion for anything tech but more specifically programming. I have a vested interest in security and software engineering fields within tech, of which I am currently perusing. 
      I have had exposure, as little as it may be, to different technologies including and not limited to Java, Python, Html, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js and Bootstrap5 framework. 
      I am a programmer by heart, I like programming and working in a team although I would prefer to work alone often.
      I am not only about tech, I have other none tech interest which include (but not limited to) tennis and rugby although I'm not the best at them, anime and manhwa, property development and real-estate.
